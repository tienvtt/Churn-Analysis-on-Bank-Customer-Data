## Key Analyses & Insights  
* **Overall Churn Rate** â€“ Percentage of customers who left the bank

* **Product Usage & Churn** â€“ Examined the effect of account activity and product subscriptions  
* **Churn Risk Prediction** â€“ Identified key factors that contribute to churn  

## Results  

The churn analysis of **9,998 customers** reveals an **overall churn rate of 20.38%**, indicating a significant portion of customers leaving the bank.  
- **The average estimated salary** of customers is **100.10K**, while  
- **The average balance** stands at **76.48K**.  

### Key Insights & Recommendations  

#### Customer Credit Card Influence  
- Customers with and without credit cards show almost equal churn rates (**50.76% vs. 49.24%**).  
- This suggests that having a credit card does not significantly impact churn, and efforts should focus on other factors.  

#### Gender-Based Churn  
- **Female customers exhibit a higher churn rate (60.34%)** compared to males (**39.66%**).  
- Targeted retention strategies should be developed for female customers, such as personalized offers or loyalty programs.  

#### Impact of Number of Products  
- Churn rate **increases as customers hold more products**, especially at **higher product tiers (3 or 4 products)**.  
- Banks should assess whether customers with multiple products are experiencing service dissatisfaction and implement engagement strategies to retain them.  

#### Age and Churn Patterns  
- Churn rate is relatively low for younger customers but **rises significantly in middle age (40â€“60 years)**.  
- Retention efforts should focus on this age group by offering **personalized financial planning services** and **exclusive benefits**.  

#### Member Status & Exit Trends  
- Inactive customers show a **much higher churn rate** than active members.  
- Proactive engagement, including **personalized outreach and improved service offerings**, could help reduce churn in at-risk customers.  

#### Credit Score Impact  
- Churn rate fluctuates across different credit scores, with **notable spikes at specific scores**.  
- This suggests a need to analyze credit-related customer pain points, possibly by offering **customized credit solutions** or **improved financial advisory services**.  

###  Actionable Recommendations  
* Implement **personalized retention strategies for male customers**.  
* Address **dissatisfaction among customers with multiple products**.  
* Analyze **credit score trends** to mitigate risks and improve retention.  
* Introduce **proactive customer service initiatives** to reduce voluntary exits.
